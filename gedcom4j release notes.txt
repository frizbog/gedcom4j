GEDCOM4J RELEASE NOTES
==============================

?? ??? 2016 - v3.0.0
====================
v3.0.0 is a major release. Most existing code using earlier versions of gedcom4j will need significant modification, primarily around the object model.

Issue #83 - The biggest change that users will see is that gedcom4j now uses the JavaBean spec for its object model and internal objects as well. Where you used to access public fields of the data model, you now need to use getters and setters.

Issue #104 - The classes in the model now implement java.io.Serializable and defined serial version UIDs.

Issue #109 - GedcomParser and StringTreeBuilder now only builds a single root-level StringTree node at a time before parsing and loading it into the object model, instead of loading the entire file into a StringTree in memory prior to parsing it.

Issue #85 - The GedcomParser class, which was a monster magic class almost 2,400 lines long, has been split up and there are a variety of parser classes that work in concert to parse input files 

Issue #112 - The Maven pom.xml file now includes the ability to ensure that all java source files have the correct license and copyright statement header

Other changes not in the Github issue tracker (https://github.com/frizbog/gedcom4j/issues) that might be visible or noticeable to calling code:
- toString() implementations of most model objects have been rewritten  


08 Jul 2016 - v2.3.1
====================
Issue #106 - File parsing and loading into object model is now done line by line on-the-fly, rather than loading the entire file into memory, then parsing the lines of the file.

Issue #108 - There is now a global options class named Options, in which you can choose whether collections in the object model should be automatically initialized (thus saving you from having to do null checks) or left null (thus saving memory).  The getter for each of these collections is overloaded with a getter that takes a boolean argument; when true, the getter will initialize the collection if needed before returning a reference. 


01 Jul 2016 - v2.3.0
====================
v2.3.0 of gedcom4j was primarily focused on improving performance for installations with smaller heap sizes and less CPU power available (for whatever reason), including the ability to get progress notification on file load/parse and construct/write operations, as well as introducing the ability to cancel these operations while in progress.

Internally, there was also a change to the AnselReader so that files with lines that exceed the 255 character limit mentioned in the GEDCOM spec continue to be read like they did before, despite the optimizations introduced for this release. AnselReader now uses a fixed-size char array to buffer data rather than a StringBuilder (for performance reasons), but the fixed size of the array introduced problems for lines that exceeded the length of the array.  To get around this, the class now internally introduces synthetic CONC tags in long lines during the file read process (as if they had been split properly according to spec), which in most cases get removed during the parse process as strings are concatenated back together (as the CONC tag indicates).  Most users won't notice anything has happened, but in case it comes up, there it is.

You may notice that gedcom4j skipped from 2.2.8 to 2.3.0 without a 2.2.9 release. 2.2.9 had snapshots that were built and put in Maven Central, but API-impacting changes were introduced, so 2.2.9 was abandoned as not released, and 2.3.0 was created in keeping with semantic versioning concepts.

The changes to the API are as follows:

o  Exceptions defined in gedcom4j are now all in the org.gedcom4j.exception package, and these are checked exceptions, so you'll probably need to touch up your imports.

o  The GedcomParser now has new methods for registering and unregistering listeners for file read progress and data parsing progress, and to set how frequently your listeners are notified. You can also cancel a load/parse operation in progress using the GedcomParser.cancel() method.

o  The GedcomWriter now has new methods for registering and unregistering listeners for progress updates on constructing string data from GEDCOM data, and for writing the files, and to set how frequently your listeners are notified. You can also cancel a construct/write operation in progress using the GedcomWriter.cancel() method.

o  Several classes were moved to new packages, including some enumerations you might be using (like Encoding) so again, you may need to touch up your imports.

o  Visibility of some classes has also changed (such as the Tag enum), so you may no longer be able to use them.

Issues addressed (see GitHub): #103, #105


10 Jun 2016 - v2.2.8 available
==============================
This release fixes an issue where two-digit level numbers were not supported like the spec requires.


2 Jun 2016 - v2.2.7 available
==============================
This was a performance improvement release. The GedcomParser class now loads files about 20 times faster than release v2.2.6.


22 May 2016 - v2.2.6 available
==============================
Two changes involve line breaks embedded within the text value of a tag. The GEDCOM spec directs implementations to split lines using CONT or CONC tags and not to have embedded line-breaks within text strings. This release brings gedcom4j into adherence to the spec on this matter, and allows more flexibility when parsing files that do not strictly conform to the spec. Issues around loading Unicode files with byte order marks and in trying to get an individual's descendants are also fixed. Details are available on the downloads page.


18 May 2016 - v2.2.5 available
==============================
This release addresses two bugs. The first was a bug where custom tags were being emitted twice by the GedcomWriter class. The other was a bug where the GedcomParser class would throw an exception when a root-level NOTE line in the GEDCOM had an XREF definition and text that looked like a cross-reference to another NOTE. The fixed code treats the text as literal text now, and adds a warning to the GedcomParser.warnings collection (since it's most likely a mistake, and not really what the specs call for).


15 Mar 2016 - v2.2.4 available
==============================
This release addresses two bugs. The first is an issue in the default String representation of an individual, where it would not show the death date correctly if the individual also had a birth date. The second is an issue where custom tags in the data structure were not being emitted by the GedcomWriter.
