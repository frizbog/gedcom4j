Here are some comments about the HEADER record 2 CONC and comments about where to look for information on the other 9 types of GEDCOM records. Most other records will 2 CONC have their own notes that describe what to look for in that record and what to hope the importing software will find.2 CONT 2 CONT Many applications will fail to import these notes. The notes are therefore also provided with the files as a plain-text 2 CONC "Read-Me" file.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT The HEADER Record:2 CONT      This record has all possible tags for a HEADER record. In uses one custom tag ("_HME") to see what the software 2 CONC will say about custom tags.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT INDIVIDUAL Records:2 CONT      This file has a small number of INDIVIDUAL records. The record named "Joseph Tag Torture" has all possible 2 CONC tags for an INDIVIDUAL record. All remaining  individuals have less tags. Some test specific features; for example:2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Standard GEDCOM Filelinks2 CONT      Name: Nonstandard Multimedia Filelinks2 CONT      Name: General Custom Filelinks2 CONT      Name: Extra URL Filelinks2 CONT           These records link to multimedia files mentioned by the GEDCOM standard and to a variety of other types of 2 CONC multimedia files, general files, or URL names.2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Chris Locked Torture2 CONT           Has a "locked" restriction (RESN) tag - should not be able to edit this record it. This record has one set of notes 2 CONC that is used to test line breaking in notes and a few other text-parsing features of the GEDCOM software. Read those 2 CONC notes to see what they are testing.2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Sandy Privacy Torture2 CONT           Has a "privacy" restriction (RESN) tag. Is the tag recognized and how is the record displayed and/or printed?2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Chris Locked Torture2 CONT      Name: Sandy Privacy Torture2 CONT      Name: Pat Smith Torture2 CONT           The three children in this file have unknown sex (no SEX tag). An ancestor tree from each should give five 2 CONC generations of ancestors.2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Charlie Accented ANSEL2 CONT      Name: Lucy Special ANSEL2 CONT           The notes in these records use all possible special characters in the ANSEL character set. The header of this file 2 CONC denotes this file as using the ANSEL character set. The importing software should handle these special characters in a 2 CONC reasonable way.2 CONT 2 CONT      Name: Torture GEDCOM Matriarch2 CONT            All individuals in this file are related and all are descendants (or spouses of descendants) of Torture GEDCOM 2 CONC Matriarch. A descendant tree or report from this individual should show five generations of descendants.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT FAMILY Records:2 CONT      The FAMILY record for "Joseph Tag Torture" (husband) and "Mary First Jones" (wife) has all tags allowed in 2 CONC family records. All other family records use only a few tags and are used to provide records for extra family links in 2 CONC other records.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT SOURCE Records:2 CONT      There are two SOURCE records in this file. The "Everything You Every Wanted to Know about GEDCOM Tags" 2 CONC source has all possible GEDCOM tags for a SOURCE record. The other source only has only a few tags.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT REPOSITORY Record:2 CONT      There is just one REPOSITORY record and it uses all possible tags for such a record.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT SUBMITTER Records:2 CONT      This file has three SUBMITTER records. The "John A. Nairn" record has all tags allowed in such records. The 2 CONC second and third submitter are to test how programs input files with multiple submitters. The GEDCOM standard does 2 CONC not allow for notes in SUBMITTER records. Look in the "Main Submitter" to verify all address data comes through, 2 CONC that all three phone numbers appear, and that the multimedia file link is preserved.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT MULTIMEDIA OBJECT Record:2 CONT      The one MULTIMEDIA record has all possible tags and even has encoded data for a small image of a flower. There 2 CONC are no known GEDCOM programs that can read or write such records. The record is included here to test how 2 CONC programs might respond to finding multimedia records present. There are possible plans to eliminate encoded 2 CONC multimedia objects in the next version of GEDCOM. In the future all multimedia will be included by links to other files. 2 CONC To test current file links and extended file links, see the "Filelinks" family records described above.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT SUBMISSION Record:2 CONT      The one (maximum allowed) SUBMISSION record in this file has all possible tags for such a record.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT NOTE Records:2 CONT      This file has many NOTE records. These are all linked to other records.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT TRLR Records:2 CONT      This file ends in the standard TRLR record.2 CONT 2 CONT --------------------------2 CONT ADDITIONAL NOTES2 CONT      This file was originally created by H. Eichmann at <h.eichmann@@mbox.iqo.uni-hannover.de> and posted on the 2 CONC Internet.2 CONT 2 CONT (NOTE: email addresses are listed here with double "at" signs. A rule of GEDCOM parsing is that these should be 2 CONC converted to single "at" at signs, but not many programs follow that rule. In addition, that rule is not needed and may be 2 CONC abandoned in a future version of GEDCOM).2 CONT 2 CONT This original file was extensively modified by J. A. Nairn using GEDitCOM 2.9.4 (1999-2001) at 2 CONC <support@@geditcom.com> and posted on the Internet at <http://www.geditcom.com>. Some changes included many 2 CONC more notes, the use or more tags, extensive testing of multimedia file links, and some notes to test all special ANSEL 2 CONC characters.2 CONT 2 CONT Feel free to copy and use this GEDCOM file for any  non-commercial purpose.2 CONT 2 CONT For selecting the allowed tags, the GEDCOM standard Release 5.5 (2 JAN 1996) was used.

How will a program handle this type of data which 1 CONC is allowed in GEDCOM? (Because some GEDCOM files get very bothered by a second 1 CONC name, the files TGC551.ged and TGC551LF files are identical to the TGC55.ged and 1 CONC TGC55LF.ged files except only one name structure is used for this individual - hence the "1" 1 CONC in their names).1 CONT 1 CONT 2. The first NAME structure has all possible subordinate tags for a NAME structure 1 CONC including source and notes a source citation and some notes. The second NAME structure 1 CONC (when used) has a source citation and some notes. Are these all imported?1 CONT 1 CONT 3. The Birth and Death events use all possible fields including subordinate tags, sources, 1 CONC multimedia links (in Birth), and notes. The birth data has an attached family link which is 1 CONC sometimes needed in case of ambiguous parentage.1 CONT 1 CONT 4. This individual has two spouses. The links to the spouses have attached notes.1 CONT 1 CONT 5. This individual has two sets of parents - natural parents and adoptive parents. Each parent 1 CONC link has attached notes. The adoptive parents has a subordinate pedigree (PEDI) tag.1 CONT 1 CONT 6. This individual has all possible events (including a generic event or EVEN structure). The 1 CONC GEDCOM tags for the events are given in the TYPE tag of each event. Some comments are:1 CONT      a. The baptism record has all possible tags for event detail.1 CONT      b. There are 2 christening records to see how programs react to duplicate events (which 1 CONC are allowed).1 CONT      c. The adoption event has a family link to give more information about adoptive parentage.1 CONT      d. The cremation event (CREM) has no data except a "Y" in the first line to indicate that 1 CONC the event has occurred. The importing software should keep this event in this record even 1 CONC though it contains no data (The GEDCOM tag is not in this TYPE tag).1 CONT      e. The LDS Baptism event tests all possible detail tags for an LDS ordinance.1 CONT      f. The LDS confirmation has no data except a "Y" in the first line to indicate that the event 1 CONC has occurred. The importing software should keep this event in this record even though it 1 CONC contains no data.1 CONT      g. The date fields in the various events test the possible GEDCOM methods for 1 CONC expressing dates, approximate dates, date ranges, and interpreted dates. There are also a few 1 CONC Hebrew dates, French Republic dates. and "B.C" dates.1 CONT 1 CONT 7. The residence structure use all possible subordinate tags in the address part of the 1 CONC residence.1 CONT 1 CONT 8. This individual has all possible attributes. The GEDCOM tags for the attributes are given 1 CONC in the TYPE tag of each attribute. Some notes are:1 CONT      a. There are 2 occupation attributes to test how programs handle multiple tags of the same 1 CONC type (which is allowed).1 CONT      b. The first OCCU attribute uses all possible subordinate tags for an attribute.1 CONT 1 CONT 9. This record has three note structures. The first is this set of notes which is in a separate 1 CONC NOTE record. The other two are NOTE structures embedded in the record. Are all imported 1 CONC and kept separate? Furthermore, the two embedded note structures have subordinate source 1 CONC citations. The second set of notes has a source citation to a SOURCE record and the third set 1 CONC of notes has an embedded source citation.1 CONT 1 CONT 10. This record has three source citations. Two are citations to a SOURCE record; one is an 1 CONC embedded source citation (used in older GEDCOM files).1 CONT 1 CONT 11. This record has one link to a multimedia file. For more testing of multimedia links, see 1 CONC the "Standard GEDCOM Filelinks," "Nonstandard Multimedia Filelinks," "General Custom 1 CONC Filelinks," and "Extra URL Filelinks" INDIVIDUAL records.1 CONT 1 CONT 12.

You can visit 1 CONC the "Nonstandard Multimedia Filelinks" record to see links to other types of multimedia files. 1 CONC You can visit the "General Custom Filelinks" and the "Extra URL Filelinks" records to see links to 1 CONC any file type and to universal resource locators.1 CONT 1 CONT NOTE: The path names for the linked files here are just the file names. A good 1 CONC GEDCOM program should search for the files and might look first in the same 1 CONC folder as this test GEDCOM file. A weaker program might be unable to locate these 1 CONC files and you will have to enter the full path names.1 CONT 1 CONT EMBEDDED Multimedia Object:1 CONT      GEDCOM 5.5 has a method for encoding multimedia objects and storing them in 1 CONC MULTIMEDIA Records.

To my knowledge, there are no genealogy 1 CONC programs that can actually read and decode such objects. The main reason for 1 CONC inclusion of the object here is to see how programs will treat this record. Good 1 CONC programs will leave them in the file (it is bad manners to delete someone's data).
