/**
 * <p>
 * A class for calculating relationships between individuals.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the idea of relationships between individuals can be a complex one. Sometimes people can have more than one
 * possible relationship between them, and the relationships between intermediates can be through marriage or blood or
 * adoption.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The relationships returned from this class do not have String names like "Father" or "Mother" for several reasons:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The String descriptions would need to be in a language, and I only know English and a <i>very</i> little German,
 * and I don't have the resources or knowledge to do a full internationalization into many languages.</li>
 * <li>There are matters of preference in string descriptions. For example, is my brother's grandson my "great-nephew"
 * or my "grand-nephew?" Does it include a space, a hyphen, or is it all rammed together?</li>
 * <li>Some users may care about step- relationships or adoptive relationships for their purposes, and others may not. A
 * string description could not serve both purposes simultaneously.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Ultimately, how the relationship is described is a presentation-layer concern, and as gedcom4j is a library with no
 * presentation layer, the descriptions are left to the consumer of the library.
